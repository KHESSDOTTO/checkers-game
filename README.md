## Checkers Game

**
This is a classic checkers game with some variations. In this ruleset, regular pieces can capture only moving forward, unles it is not the first capture of a combo.

The king can only move one square per round, but can move to all directions.

Capture is mandatory. If not done, the piece (or pieces) that did not capture when will be lost.
